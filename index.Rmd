## in this file our original document is KAdebowaleGender_SBU original 050117  test  (1).xlsx.
## I open the file using Excel, then sort it according to StudentNumber column
## then save it as KAdebowaleGender_SBU.csv file to use

## read the data into RStudio

```{r}
grading = read.csv("KAdebowaleGender_SBU.csv")
```


# The purpose of this project is to  calculate the correlation between the final grade
## 1. total Hits  (column CW)

```{r}
data1 = grading[,c("TotalGrade", "TotalDBMFhits")]
```

## because the data doesn't have any NA and NULL data, we don't need to deal with that
## create training set and test set

```{r}
require(caret)
seed = as.numeric(as.Date("2017-04-19"))
set.seed(seed)
inTrain = createDataPartition(data1$TotalGrade, p=0.7)
trainingset <- data1[inTrain[[1]],]
testset = data1[-inTrain[[1]],]
```
